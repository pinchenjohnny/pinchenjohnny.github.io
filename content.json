In this article, I‚Äôll introduce: Cmder: an intergrated shells console. WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux, an embedded Linux kernel to give you Linux shell when you use Windows. oh-my-zsh: a powerful and beautiful shell to replace Linux bash. their sources, installation steps and usage. After finishing this, you could get: say goodbye to cmd or powershell, replace these with Cmder and its convenient hotkeys. run Linux shell commands when using Windows OS. fast file management and commands operation experience. For what I not introduce, please check each tool‚Äôs doc given in relative part OR ask in Q&amp;A platform like Superuser. Prerequsition: Win 10 OS Anaconda package: download Linux version from the official site. Contents: 1. Cmder 1.1 Install 1.2 Hotkeys 2. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) 2.1 Install 2.2 Usage 3. oh-my-zsh 3.1 Install 3.2 Usage 4. [Optional] Install Anaconda and Node.js 4.1 Anaconda 4.2 Node.js and nvm References 1. CmderCmder concrete introduction and manual in github. 1.1 Install(1) Download the latest release. (2) extract and run Cmder.exe. 1.2 Hotkeys`Ctrl + ``: Global Summon from taskbar Alt + Enter: Fullscreen Ctrl + t: New tab dialog Ctrl + w: Close tab Win + Alt + p: Preferences Ctrl + shift + r: new a tab, split it to the right. If not successful, check Preferences -&gt; Keys &amp; Macro Ctrl + r: History search 2. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)WSL doc by Microsoft. 2.1 Install(1) Toggle Developer mode In Windows, open Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; For Developers. Fig 2.1 Toggle developer mode (2) Toggle Window feature WSL Open Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Turn windows features on or off. Toggle Windows Subsystem for Linux in the pop-up window. Fig 2.2 Toggle Window feature WSL (3) Install Ubuntu Search Ubuntu in Microsoft Store. Install Ubuntu the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 2.2 UsageReboot and run Ubuntu. Voila, you get your Linux shell in Windows. Fig 2.3 Linux shell in Windows But we want this shell in Cmder. Open Cmder preferences -&gt; Startup -&gt; Tasks. Add a {bash::ubuntu} task like Fig 2.4 %windir%\\system32\\bash.exe ~ -cur_console:p Fig 2.4 Add Ubuntu task in Cmder Ctrl + T to create a new console, choose {bash::ubuntu} and start. To start Cmder with Ubuntu bash, open Preferences -&gt; Startup, toggle Specified named task and select {bash::ubuntu}. Fig 2.5 Start Cmder with Ubuntu bash For Anaconda and node.js installation, see 4. [Optional] Install Anaconda and Node.js. 3. oh-my-zshoh-my-zsh in github. The actual shell we use to replace Ubuntu bash is called zsh, while oh-my-zsh is the framework to easily manage zsh config. So, install zsh first. 3.1 Install(1) Install zsh In WSL Ubuntu bash in Cmder: sudo apt-get install zsh zsh --version the second line to check whether successfully install zsh. (2) Install oh-my-zsh sh -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&quot; 3.2 UsageYou can input ‚Äúzsh‚Äù to switch bash to zsh, but we want {bash::ubuntu} task start with zsh, so add: exec zsh in the end of ~/.bashrc. The power of zsh shows in its customization and plugins. (1) Customization In ~/.zshrc, add: # set alias alias cls=&#39;clear&#39; alias grep=&quot;grep --color=auto&quot; alias javac=&quot;javac -J-Dfile.encoding=utf8&quot; alias ll=&#39;ls -l&#39; alias la=&#39;ls -a&#39; alias py=&quot;python&quot; alias vi=&#39;vim&#39; alias -s bz2=&#39;tar -xjvf&#39; the above line is to set: input file-name.bz2 in cmd line, open the .bz2 file with tar -xjvf, that is the follow two are equal: file-name.bz2 tar -xjvf file-name.bz2 Similar as: alias -s c=vi alias -s gz=&#39;tar -xzvf&#39; alias -s html=mate alias -s java=vi alias -s js=vi alias -s py=vi alias -s rb=mate alias -s tgz=&#39;tar -xzvf&#39; alias -s txt=vi alias -s zip=&#39;unzip&#39; (2) Plugin Git: show git:(branch) when u in a git control dir. simplify git commands like g=git. See ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh in detail. Autojump: Autojump in github. Autojumo will record your visited dir. Use cmd j to jump in directly. git clone git://github.com/wting/autojump.git cd autojump python ./install.py check wether the following add to ~/.zshrc. The path may be different. Refer to the prompts when installing: # autojump . /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-autosuggestions in github. As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. za For installation, clone it to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins: cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions add the following to ~/.zshrc to start a termial with zsh-autosuggestions: # zsh-autosuggestions source ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh For usage, press the ‚Üí key to accept the completion offered in a muted gray color. 4. [Optional] Install Anaconda and Node.js4.1 AnacondaAnaconda official site. Anaconda is a python distribution, with installation and package management tools, like conda and jupyter. Download its installer for Linux from the official site. # run the Anaconda script and complete installation process bash Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh Add the the following to ~/.zshrc if commands like conda not work: # anaconda export PATH=$PATH:/home/pinchen/anaconda3/bin 4.2 Node.js and nvmNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. I use nvm to install and manage Node.js in WSL Ubuntu. nvm in github. (1) Install nvm curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash If successfully installed, the following will output nvm: command -v nvm If not work, add these to ~/.zshrc: # nvm export NVM_DIR=&quot;$HOME/.nvm&quot; [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \\. &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot; # This loads nvm [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \\. &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot; # This loads nvm bash_completion (2) Install Node.js nvm install node # &quot;node&quot; is an alias for the latest version References Windows10ÂºÄÂêØUbuntuÂ≠êÁ≥ªÁªüÁÆÄÊòìÊ≠•È™§, Raysmond Windows10ÁªàÁ´Ø‰ºòÂåñÊñπÊ°àÔºöUbuntuÂ≠êÁ≥ªÁªü+cmder+oh-my-zsh, Raysmond ÁªàÊûÅ Shell‚Äî‚ÄîZSH, Ê±†Âª∫Âº∫","categories":[{"name":"OS","slug":"OS","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/OS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Windows","slug":"Windows","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Windows/"},{"name":"DevTools","slug":"DevTools","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/DevTools/"}]}]}

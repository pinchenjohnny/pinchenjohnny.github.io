Initialize terminal with zsh and vim with dotfiles. 1. dotfilesBasically speaking, Linux config files are start with ., like .zshrc for oh-my-zsh and .vim for vim. People share their customized config on GitHub http://dotfiles.github.io/. You can easily get and learn how others setup their OS and softwares. http://dotfiles.github.io/ You can also backup and sync through GitHub, as easily as create a repo and upload your dotfiles into it, Here is mine pin-dotfiles. Warning You shouldn‚Äôt upload your files with secrets like passwords or other sensitive information to a public repo! pin dotfiles 2. Initialize terminal with dotfilesIt is intelligent to use sh scripts to do duplicated jobs like initialization every time you hand on a new system. But, today let‚Äôs manually download dotfiles and make things work. Before it, think about what softwares you mostly use to dev. It‚Äôs safe to say shell and vim. Here, I‚Äôll use my dotfiles to demonstarte. And I‚Äôll introduce what I customized in 3. My zsh and zsh customization. 2.1 Install vim and zshVim is usually installed with the system. Run vi to check. If not, I suggest install neovim instead, which is a reconstructed vim and compatibale with vim configurations. cat /etc/shells to check whether zsh is installed. If not, find how in zsh wiki. oh-my-zsh is a framework to help manage zsh configuration. # install zsh on Ubuntu apt install zsh # change current shell to zsh chsh -s $(which zsh) # install oh-my-zsh sh -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&quot; 2.2 Plant dotfiles# prepare dotfiles git clone https://github.com/pinchenjohnny/pin-dotfiles.git cd pin-dotfiles cp -t ~/ .vim .zshrc zsh-autosuggestions is a commands prompt based on input history. autojump: jump to visted directory arbitrarily using command j &lt;visited dir&gt;. # make zsh work cd ~ # install zsh-autosuggestions git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions # install autojump git clone git://github.com/wting/autojump.git cd autojump python ./install.py cd ~ # REMEMBER to change /home/pinchen to your home dir in .zshrc source .zshrc vim-plug is a vim plugins manager. # make vim work # for neovim, this is slightly different # check neovim github for details cd ~ # install vim-plug curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim cd ~/.vim vi vimrc To install vim plugins via vim-plug, in vim command line mode of vimrc, input PlugInstall. 3. My zsh and zsh customizationIn this part, I‚Äôll simply introduce features of my customization and some frequently used operations. Check .zshrc and .vim/vimrc for more information. 3.1 zshDouble hit Esc to add sudo to current command. Alias like: alias la=&#39;ls -a&#39; alias ll=&#39;ls -al&#39; alias gc=&#39;git clone&#39; alias ga=&#39;git add -A&#39; alias gcm=&#39;git commit -m&#39; alias gp=&#39;git push&#39; Use j &lt;visited dir&gt; to jump to visited dir from anywhere. 3.2 vimI adjust my vim config from theniceboy/.vim. Go and check his if you are a colemakkeyboard layout user. My vim leader key is Space.

Fig 2.5 Start Cmder with Ubuntu bash For Anaconda and node.js installation, see 4. [Optional] Install Anaconda and Node.js. 3. oh-my-zshoh-my-zsh in github. The actual shell we use to replace Ubuntu bash is called zsh, while oh-my-zsh is the framework to easily manage zsh config. So, install zsh first. 3.1 Install(1) Install zsh In WSL Ubuntu bash in Cmder: sudo apt-get install zsh zsh --version the second line to check whether successfully install zsh. (2) Install oh-my-zsh sh -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&quot; 3.2 UsageYou can input ‚Äúzsh‚Äù to switch bash to zsh, but we want {bash::ubuntu} task start with zsh, so add: exec zsh in the end of ~/.bashrc. The power of zsh shows in its customization and plugins. (1) Customization In ~/.zshrc, add: # set alias alias cls=&#39;clear&#39; alias grep=&quot;grep --color=auto&quot; alias javac=&quot;javac -J-Dfile.encoding=utf8&quot; alias ll=&#39;ls -l&#39; alias la=&#39;ls -a&#39; alias py=&quot;python&quot; alias vi=&#39;vim&#39; alias -s bz2=&#39;tar -xjvf&#39; the above line is to set: input file-name.bz2 in cmd line, open the .bz2 file with tar -xjvf, that is the follow two are equal: file-name.bz2 tar -xjvf file-name.bz2 Similar as: alias -s c=vi alias -s gz=&#39;tar -xzvf&#39; alias -s html=mate alias -s java=vi alias -s js=vi alias -s py=vi alias -s rb=mate alias -s tgz=&#39;tar -xzvf&#39; alias -s txt=vi alias -s zip=&#39;unzip&#39; (2) Plugin Git: show git:(branch) when u in a git control dir. simplify git commands like g=git. See ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh in detail. Autojump: Autojump in github. Autojumo will record your visited dir. Use cmd j to jump in directly. git clone git://github.com/wting/autojump.git cd autojump python ./install.py check wether the following add to ~/.zshrc. The path may be different. Refer to the prompts when installing: # autojump . /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-autosuggestions in github. As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. za For installation, clone it to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins: cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions add the following to ~/.zshrc to start a termial with zsh-autosuggestions: # zsh-autosuggestions source ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh For usage, press the ‚Üí key to accept the completion offered in a muted gray color. 4. [Optional] Install Anaconda and Node.js4.1 AnacondaAnaconda official site. Anaconda is a python distribution, with installation and package management tools, like conda and jupyter. Download its installer for Linux from the official site. # run the Anaconda script and complete installation process bash Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh Add the following to ~/.zshrc if commands like conda not work: # anaconda export PATH=$PATH:/home/pinchen/anaconda3/bin 4.2 Node.js and nvmNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. I use nvm to install and manage Node.js in WSL Ubuntu. nvm in github.
